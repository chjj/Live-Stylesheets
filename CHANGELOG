Live Stylesheets - CSS Editing
(c) Copyright 2010-2011, Christopher Jeffrey (http://epsilon-not.net/)

UPDATE: v0.16
- Cleaned up a lot of code. Technical stuff:
  The UI's CSS is now stored externally - should improve performance.
  The stylesheet loading function now uses a parallel asynchronous loop.

- Live stylesheets now loads lazily. 
  This means the elements wont be pre-loaded on every page. This should generally improve 
	performance when browsing with live stylesheets enabled, however toggling the live 
	stylesheets frame for the first time on a page may seem a fraction of a second slower.

- Added options:
  KEY_CODE - The keyCode for the toggle key. Default is 120 (F9).
  TAB_SIZE - The number of spaces a tab should be. Default is 8.
  USE_SPACES - Use spaces in place of tabs. Default is false.
  UPDATE_TIME - The amount of time to wait after a key stroke before 
	  updating the CSS. Default is 300 (ms).
  UNMINIFY - Detect whether the stylesheet is minfied. Attempt 
    to unminify and pretty print it. Default is false. (EXPERIMENTAL)
	
  You can set these at the top of the "live.js" file. 
  Although I may add a more formal options page eventually, I like to keep things simple.

UPDATE: v0.15
- Fixed a problem with @imported stylesheets.
